Just finished up a small game for JS13kgames2021, I was going to add sound
and polish it some more, but I started working on a Rust app, so I guess its
done for now lol.  Its *kind of* asteroids, the player just needs to pretend
the squares look like asteroids :^).
\
Also new: make a script that generates PDF's from .md docs; It could be cool for
making a bunch of documentation really quick, especially if the documentation is
intended for non-technical people since they will just get the PDFs, no need to teach
anyone about markdown or README files.

My next few projects will (probably) be made with Rust, I really want to mess around more
with that. Rocket seems cool, and Amethyst has been fun to use so far!
