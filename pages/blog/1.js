                This is my second attempt at a blog in one year, 
                and by that I mean 2nd attempt at making a blog site
                and just not replacing or changing it lmao.

                I made the last blog with PHP and my own CSS, which was
                cool to me because I haven't really used PHP that much
                and I enjoy writing CSS for a project starting with 
                nothing but a blank page.  This blog is exciting (at the
                moment) as well though, since I plan on not only using it 
                as a blog but also as a testing ground for using NextJS.
                I chose water.css for the styles, I have been using classless 
                libraries as of late.

                I am going to use the free Netlify hosting service for now, 
                but I will probably throw this onto a Linode or something to 
                save money.
