## blog #9 | new year, new blog (sort of)
\
Its 2022 and I wanted a new blog, but I kind of liked the current one so I ended up updating it.  I like the new look more, it looks more complete and also includes some features that have been needed for awhile!

\
The blogs page now lists blog dynamically, and the blogs arent react components they are now .md files. I was initially going to make this a normal React app, but only being able to see the blog when Javascript is enabled in the browser, even in 2022, is still such a limiting factor.  
\
I think the next features I will add will be fun - for an upcoming change I was thinking about adding a comments section where commentors would be made to draw with their mice instead of type on their keyboards üòÅ.

Anyways, bye till next time!
